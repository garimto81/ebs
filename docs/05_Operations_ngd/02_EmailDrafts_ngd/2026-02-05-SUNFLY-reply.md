Hi Susie,

Thank you for your positive response. It's encouraging to hear that Sun-Fly is interested in working together on this.

Let me share more details about what we're looking for, so you can assess whether this is a good fit for both sides.

We're developing a real-time card recognition system for live poker broadcasting. The system needs to automatically identify each playing card as it's dealt and display the information on the broadcast screen instantly.

We're looking for a partner who can provide an integrated solution covering both RFID-embedded playing cards and the reader hardware.

**What we need:**

1. RFID Playing Cards
   - Standard poker size (63 x 88mm), RFID tag embedded in each card
   - 54 cards per deck (52 + 2 jokers), each uniquely identifiable
   - Durable enough for professional use (repeated handling over multi-hour sessions)

2. RFID Reader Hardware
   - Compact form factor suitable for embedding into a poker table surface
   - Capable of identifying a single card within 200ms
   - Stable continuous operation for 4+ hours
   - Software integration interface (SDK, API, or protocol documentation)

3. Integration Support
   - Our team handles the software integration
   - We need the hardware to provide card identification data that our software can consume
   - Development documentation and technical support during integration

**Questions:**

1. Can Sun-Fly supply both the RFID cards and the reader hardware, or only one of them?
2. When you mentioned a "customizable solution," does that include both the cards and the reader, or primarily one side?
3. Do you have experience with similar card identification or real-time RFID projects?
4. Is it possible to start with a small pilot (e.g., 5-10 reader units and 50-100 card decks) for evaluation?
5. What would be the approximate timeline and cost range for a pilot?

I'd be happy to schedule a call to discuss this in more detail if that works better for you.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Aiden
